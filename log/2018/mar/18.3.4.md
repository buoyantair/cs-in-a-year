## Notes
- I got a bit frustrated today and I got really annoyed about myself. While I was just wasting time on snapchat watching random snaps, I felt like I should just get more commited, and that I can't just leave everything like that. This decision made me to quickly finish up a quick project to track twitter feed on a particular topic, and I also finished my long awaited course "How to Code: Simple Data"!! Finally! The final project was a bit complex and hard but thank god the tests and everything I learnt from the course helped a lot!
