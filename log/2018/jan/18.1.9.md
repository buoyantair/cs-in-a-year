## Notes 
- The progress doesn't show much today, but I did do some good amount of work.
- I've worked on Duolingo for some time, sharpening up my french skills ;)
- As always, Racket is one of those languages that, at the first glance seem to be very weird and super confusing but as you code along systematically, you feel like you haven't done any coding or hard work at all. Because you'd already have figured out how to solve a problem before hand on pen and paper. I think this is an awesome strategy. I do this all the time when I am solving algorithms on hackerrank and codingame etc. Writing something down on paper or typing out what you have to do just makes everything so clear and so simple to consume later on! While this is something I already know, I really like how TDD can impact your programming and thought process. Adding in check-expects for every function requires thinking, which leads you to understanding your code better and that means, you can now implement much efficient code! and tests too, heck.
- Practiced some compound data problems etc. Racket is now becoming more "less boring"!
- Later on I went onto working on my personal project, graphblog. This is a blog that I am building in order to get familiar with graphql. Graphql is freaking awesome. Now I don't have to always be worrying about implementing different endpoint for different needs. I implemented a Post editor today so that users can now login and create new posts. The post editor is based on markdown for now but maybe in the future I want to start my own simple project where I make a text editor with interactive elements. I also added in deletePost functionality cus I had some time.
- Worked on a collaborative project between me and some old friends. We're building sort of like a game where 2 teams are present. Let's assume they're Red and Blue. So the goal of the Red players is to fight their way into the Blue player's territory and hold the terminal for a period of time. If they are able to hold the terminal for a set period, the red players win, or else the blue players win. I created a dock today where the red players, aka the raiders spawn. They will spawn in a dock because they are... raiders and come from a different place haha you get the point. I also made a water fall today :3 and helped the friend out with terrain here and there.
