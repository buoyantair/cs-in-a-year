## Notes
- I really liked today's homework from chilli. It was not that hard, and it was not that easy, It was fun trying to remember something you solved a couple of years ago. And more over, I used pen and paper this time. :) 
- Today's french practice was good, I think I am now able to understand or atleast make sense of what's happening in the conversations occuring in my job's slack channel! I find some french words hard to pronounce, or hear. Not a big deal for now as I've just starting out, and I don't want to stress out either. I'm pretty sure I'll burn out.
- Besides that, there was no internet in the 1st quarter of the day, so instead I turned towards Racket and played around with it. I checkedout how to make webservers in Racket via the documentation. The process of creating a website via racket seemed a little tedious, but hey, I was just touching the surface. Maybe there's some magic to it? :O
