## Notes
- I went out to the city today, so it's obvious I haven't done any work. 
- I did however, manage to get my daily dose of French practice ;) 
- I was able to wake up early and do some exercise too, oof, the exercise was a bit hard today as it only stressed on my arms. It's not bad if my arms hurt during exercise anyways haha!
