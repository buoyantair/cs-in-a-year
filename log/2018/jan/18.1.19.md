## Notes 
- The power of habit is a pretty cool book, as I had headache today, I laid in the bedroom and finished this wonderful book. I am thinking about writing an article on it tomorrow, let's go for it?! :D (a review :3, a good excuse to practice my writing skills!)
- The workout was exhausting, and hard, especially since I was cold and have a headache, but I went through it, it felt good when warm water touches your skin and head after a sweaty workout! :O
