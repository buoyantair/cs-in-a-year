## Notes
- Finished Phrases topic and partially finished Food topic in french course, in Duolingo. It was fairly good, I like how some french words like "merci beaucoup" sound to me! The sad thing is  that the Duolingo's voice when talking in french is not quite understandable all the time. Sometimes the bass or treble is pretty high I guess, IDK but it's a bit hard to understand how to pronounce sometimes. Besides that I think french is freaking cool. I never had quite a lot of problem learning to speak or read a language! I did have some difficulty with writing though, but French is pretty much like english, so heck ya!

- Chilli omg, he's freaking cool. Although I already know about game structure and all, I think it was pretty enjoyable. I like how classes and objects are defined in C++. I really like how the Header files document everything about a class and how you can instantiate and use variables etc. Pretty cool stuff.

- Besides these, I've done a couple more things like following through 1-2 Nature of Code course videos, and following through How to design worlds in HTC:Simple Data course. I still need to do the problems though, which I'll do tomorrow first thing in the morning.
