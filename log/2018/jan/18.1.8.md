## Notes 
- Worked on some old ROBLOX projects and fixed a broken game.
- I met some old friends, so we discussed about making a new game for our clan Nexia. We planned about different map layouts and strategies. We are planning to revamp most of the 3D models into modern architects with neon and other sci-fi stuff.
- Also practiced some HTC:Simple Data stuff, I'm at how to design compound data now.
- Duolingo as usual, I strengthened some skills. On 9th, I will try to go past level 7.
