# cs-in-a-year
I push all the work that I do to learn CS on my own to this repository. The work usually includes lots of code, 
and implementations of different algorithms, data structures etc. 

I'm following a hybrid version of [teachyourselfcs](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com/), [p1xt guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) and [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/).

## Rules

1. Always be working on one course.
1. Add bonus objectives from bonus list as often as desired.
