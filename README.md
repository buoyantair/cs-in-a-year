# Things we do
A repo to track my progress.

I'm following a hybrid version of [teachyourselfcs](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com/), [p1xt guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) and [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/).

Date started: 4 / 1 / 2018

## Rules

1. Always be working on one course.
2. All Assignments must be complete for course to be considered complete.

## Dump
A list of things I really want to go through, but you can only do so many at a given time! I think this is the place I'll put anything else that comes up to my interest. Later on as I finish tasks, I will add tasks to the course. :)
