# cs-in-a-year
I push all the work that I do to learn CS on my own to this repository. The work usually includes lots of code, 
and implementations of different algorithms, data structures etc. 

I'm following a hybrid version of [teachyourselfcs](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com/), p1xt guides and OSSU.

A clear list of what I'll follow will be put here soon!
