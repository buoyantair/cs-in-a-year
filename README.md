# Progress for 2019

A repo to track my progress over the years.

I'm following a hybrid version of [teachyourselfcs](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com/), [p1xt guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) and [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/) and from progress files of my previous years :)
